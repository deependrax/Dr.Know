Eric Schmidt was on Apple's board and Google Maps was included on the iPhone.\n\nAfter the iPhone came out and was successful, Google changed their whole strategy with Android and created something that was essentially a crappier version of the iPhone. Given that they perhaps had access to early information about the iPhone and perhaps even knew strategy details of where the project was going to go in the future, this seems like a betrayal of trust.\n\nFurthermore, there's very, very little about Android that's innovative as compared to the iPhone.
